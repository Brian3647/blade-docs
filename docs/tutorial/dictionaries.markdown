# Dictionaries

Blade dictionaries are built on powerful hashtables with fast key lookups. Creating Blade dictionaries
are extremely similar to how you create objects in JavaScript and for developers coming from that
language will find Blade dictionaries very familiar.

Blade dictionaries are arbitary key/value pairs separated by colons (`:`) enclosed in braces (`{}`).

For example:

```blade-repl
%> {name: 'Blade'}
{name: Blade}
%> {}    # empty dictionary
{}
```
